# Wayland-native-client-Vulkan
## About
This is an example on creating a hardware accelerated wayland client with the vulkan api.
This was tested on a rtx 3080 so make sure that the required extensions, features and extent/formats are supported althrough there are checks to make sure.
Since there is no shader compilation code, you need to compile them externally into SPIR-V bytecode.
